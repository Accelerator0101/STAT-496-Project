Project Ideas — STAT 496 Capstone

- Idea 1: Prompt Wording Sensitivity and Output Variability
We will study how small changes in prompt wording (e.g., politeness, specificity, or framing) affect the variability and consistency of LLM outputs. 
The experiment will involve systematically modifying prompts, collecting multiple responses per condition via API calls, and comparing response similarity
using embedding-based distance metrics and summary statistics.

- Idea 2: Reproducibility of LLM Outputs Under Identical Conditions
This project investigates how reproducible LLM responses are when given the same prompt repeatedly under identical settings (temperature, model, system prompt). 
We will quantify variability across runs and analyze how parameters such as temperature influence output stability.

- Idea 3: Bias in LLM Responses Across Demographic Cues
We will examine whether LLM responses differ when prompts include different demographic signals (e.g., names, occupations, or geographic references). 
The analysis will compare sentiment, content themes, and linguistic features across conditions using statistical tests and regression models.
